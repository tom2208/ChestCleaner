<h2># ChestCleaner</h2>
ChestCleaner is a Minecraft Spigot plugin that sorts your chests and inventories. (+ Autorefill for items in the hotbar)

I'm using the Spigot API version for MC v. 1.15.1-R0.1-SNAPSHOT

For more information have a look at the Spigot article of this plugin: https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/chestcleaner-sorting-plugin.40313/
